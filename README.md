`KVDK` (Key-Value Development Kit) is a key-value store library implemented in C++ language. It is designed for supporting Optane persistent memory, DRAM and CXL memory pool. It also demonstrates several optimization methods for high performance with tiered memory. Besides providing the basic APIs of key-value store, it offers several advanced features, like read-modify-write, checkpoint, etc.

**Notice: The DRAM engine and CXL memory pool are in development, you can checkout to v1.0 for a release version of PMEM based persistent engine.**
